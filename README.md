# History to Drive

History to Drive is a browser extension (for Chrome, Firefox) that appends your browser history to an Excel spreadsheet in OneDrive. It currently captures the following: time, tags, page title, page host, page URL, and user agent (with some extra empty columns reserved for more convenience in adding potential future features).

The extension sends data only to the Excel spreadsheet. So, no data or authorization is sent anywhere else (via [Proof Key for Code Exchange by OAuth Public Clients](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636)), and the only party to trust with your data is Microsoft OneDrive.

Why would you want to track your browser history? There are many reasons, I can only speak for myself. I want more control over and insight into my "digital exhaust". I know Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox both offer history tracking and syncing. However, there is no easy way to download, query, tag, analyze, and combine this browsing data. Moreover, it's a burden to keep tabs on more online-only services with their own terms and conditions. With a spreadsheet instead, I can control the data however I want to.
